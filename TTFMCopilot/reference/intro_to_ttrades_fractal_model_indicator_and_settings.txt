how's it going everyone this video is
0:12
going to be a basic introduction into my
0:14
fractal model however the main focus of
0:17
this video is going to be going over my
0:19
indicator and its settings and how it is
0:21
used so let's hop into the first example
0:24
here to explain the fractal model and
0:26
then how the indicator would plot it so
Intro Fractal Model
0:28
my fractal model relies on the
0:30
foundational understanding that the
0:31
market cannot reverse without a swing
0:33
point so you can see here the market has
0:35
formed a swing point to reverse or go
0:38
from bearish to bullish and if we are
0:40
going to reverse from bullish to bearish
0:42
we are also going to form a swing point
0:44
now what do I use to determine if the
0:46
market is likely to reverse I will use
0:48
candle closures so you can see here
0:51
price has swept out its previous candle
0:53
high and then closed back inside the
0:55
range so if you've seen my daily bias
0:58
video you know that I would be bearish
0:59
or looking for previous day low so with
1:02
that understanding that I'd be looking
1:04
for a previous day low or a run lower
1:06
this next day I'd be looking for an open
1:09
high low close now to confirm this bias
1:12
I would go down to the hourly time frame
1:14
from the daily and look to see if we
1:16
have a change in the state of delivery
1:19
so down here on the hourly chart do we
1:20
have a change in the state of delivery
1:22
confirming the swing Point well you can
1:25
see we have closed through the series of
1:27
up closed candles that have made this
1:29
high so I consider this High protected
1:31
and then I will look to trade the Open
1:34
high low close in the following candle
1:36
so you can see here as we let this play
1:39
out you can see we reach higher we sweep
1:42
out a high to the left and then we get
1:44
an opposing candle formation here so I'd
1:47
anticipate this Wick to have formed and
1:49
then I can look to trade this lower the
1:51
rest of the day so I could either get on
1:53
side in this next candle here or in this
1:56
hourly candle or wait for a New York
1:58
session
2:00
so you can see here as we approach the
2:01
New York session what happens we sweep
2:04
out this High to the left we then close
2:07
through the down close candle that made
2:10
that high so if I wanted to put on a
2:12
position I could put on a position on
2:14
the close of this candle my stop on the
2:17
high and looking for 2 R let's see how
2:20
this works
2:22
out so it makes us wait some time but we
2:25
do hit our TP on that trade so just to
2:27
review the foundational Concepts within
2:30
the fractal Model A Higher time frame
2:32
closure in this case price swept out its
2:34
previous day high and closed back inside
2:36
the range we have a change in the state
2:38
of delivery that confirms that reversal
2:41
and then in the following candle I'm
2:43
looking to trade the Open high low close
2:46
is that is what is determined by my
2:48
higher time frame bias so you can see
2:50
here this is how I would mark it out now
2:52
to make this more efficient for myself
2:54
with the help of two degrees I have
2:55
designed my own indicator to mark this
2:57
out all for me so let's go ahead and
Indicator
2:59
rewalk through through this price action
3:00
but with my
3:01
indicator so you can see on this new
3:04
candle close it has identified that it's
3:06
taken the previous day's High closed
3:08
back inside the range and is also paired
3:11
with a change in the state of delivery
3:13
with this it will Mark out projections
3:14
to give myself targets as well as Mark
3:17
out a t-spot which is an area that I
3:19
look for higher time frame Wicks to be
3:21
formed so for instance if we are going
3:23
to trade lower here I would like to see
3:25
price trade into this gray area form a
3:29
high or a higher time frame Wick and
3:30
then trade lower throughout the day as
3:32
we let this continue out this is when I
3:34
would then Mark up my opposing candle
3:37
formation and I'd like to see this trade
3:39
lower throughout the
3:41
day and you can see as we get into the
3:44
next day here because we have closed
3:46
bearish I will then look for a
3:48
continuation in this following candle if
3:51
we let this play
3:52
out you can see we do get this
3:56
continuation
3:57
lower and then we finally go and take
4:00
out these lows to our left so you can
4:03
see that is what my indicator looks like
4:05
now let's go back and take a look at
4:07
this New York session setup where we
4:09
have swept out this High here since my
4:11
model is fractal hence the name of the
4:13
fractal model I can apply this on
4:15
multiple time frames so here we are on
4:17
the daily and hourly but let's say I
4:19
wanted to go in here on the hourly and 5
4:22
minute I could go ahead and rewind this
4:24
drop down to the 5 minute time frame and
4:27
the indicator would auto adjust for that
4:29
so you can see we've taken out this high
4:32
if I had a bearish bias I could go ahead
4:35
and switch this to bearish and it only
4:38
seek out the bearish setups and then as
4:41
I let this continue here we get this
4:44
higher time frame candle closure the 5
4:46
minute setup and then I'm anticipating
4:48
the higher time frame Wick to form in
4:50
this area to trade lower so as we let
4:52
this play
4:54
out you can see we respect that area and
4:57
then we get a continuation there to the
5:00
lows to the left and to our standard
5:02
deviation projections so let's go ahead
Settings
5:05
and go through all my indicator settings
5:07
so the first setting is a warning and
5:09
air messages do I want to have that
5:11
turned on I personally do because if I'm
5:13
not on an automatic time frame let's say
5:15
I am on the 1 minute and 15 minute model
5:18
and I'm on the 5 minute time frame I'm
5:20
going to get an error because the 5
5:21
minute is greater than the 1 minute or
5:23
the lower time frame in that case so I
5:25
want to see that time frame and I can
5:27
see that I need to go to a 1 minute time
5:29
frame or below to view it now in our
5:32
general settings if I want to get alerts
5:34
when setups form I'm going to go ahead
5:36
and have this toggle turned on and
5:38
follow the instructions to get the
5:40
alerts that I want to have now in terms
5:43
of History this is going to show how
5:45
many previous setups on the chart so if
5:48
I only want to see the current setup I
5:49
can go ahead and make that a zero and it
5:52
would only show the current setup so for
5:54
instance if I let this continue to play
5:56
out it would then disappear if I have
5:58
that set up to one then it would go
6:00
ahead and show the most recent setup and
6:03
I can go all the way up to 40 for those
6:04
setups so let's say I go to 15 hit okay
6:09
you can see this will show the last 15
6:11
bearish setups because I also have my
6:13
bias to bearish so let's go ahead and
6:16
pull back up our settings here now C2 C3
6:19
and C4 are the higher time frame candle
6:21
closures now I go over all the
6:23
requirements for these within my course
6:25
and mentorship but essentially this
6:27
means candle 2 candle 3 candle 4 and
6:30
then specific candle closures with that
6:32
so you can see this will show a candle
6:34
two closure if I don't want to see a
6:36
candle two closure I go ahead and turn
6:38
that off then I will only see candle 3
6:40
closures with candle 4 continuation I
6:42
personally like to have all of these on
6:44
because I like to view all of them now
6:46
you may notice on the chart there are a
6:47
few different colors of these C2 C3 and
6:50
C4 a gray C2 is when the setup has
6:53
remained valid throughout candle 4 a red
6:56
C2 is when that setup fails within the
6:58
first candle and an orange C2 is when
7:01
that setup fails but not the first
7:03
candle after but the second candle after
7:06
now going into my bias this is where I
7:08
can select my bias so in the previous
7:10
example I just showed you I was bearish
7:12
going into the New York session so I
7:14
went ahead and selected it to bearish
7:16
and you can see how all of the bullish
7:18
setups will disappear as I have chosen a
7:20
bearish setup right and so that will
7:22
only show me the bearish setups if I
7:25
want to see bullish I can go ahead and
7:27
select bullish and then it will show me
7:29
all the bullish setups and not the
7:31
bearish if I don't have any bias or a
7:34
neutral bias I can select neutral and it
7:36
will show me both bearish and bullish
7:38
setups now the cool thing about this
7:40
indicator is I can go ahead and adjust
7:42
my kill zones through the time frame
7:44
filter so for instance you can see all
7:46
of these different setups here but let's
7:48
say I'm only interested in price in the
7:50
New York session between 8 to 11:30 so I
7:53
could go ahead and take a look at this
7:56
adjust it from 8 to
7:58
11:30 right and one thing about this
8:00
it's going to choose the whole hours
8:02
candle so this means I would have to
8:04
wait for the 9:00 a.m. closure so if I
8:06
want to include the whole 8 Hour closure
8:08
I'm going to have to choose 7 a.m. for
8:11
this with that selection it has removed
8:13
all of the setups that were not inside
8:15
the Kill Zone now if I have multiple
8:17
different kill zones I can have up to
8:19
three so let's say I want to view London
8:21
and New York am session I can go ahead
8:23
and select that and then I'll get those
8:25
setups as well now going into a few of
8:28
the customizable settings
8:30
the higher time frame candles or the
8:31
power of three candles on the right side
8:34
I have the option to hide those if I
8:35
don't want to view them and then I can
8:38
also change the size of them so you can
8:40
see now they are hidden I will go ahead
8:42
and bring them back and you can adjust
8:44
the size of them between small medium
8:47
and large now an offset will offset it
8:49
from your chart So currently it has this
8:51
default offset of this location here
8:54
where it's going to offset it about that
8:56
much let's say I want more space between
8:59
myart chart in my higher time frame
9:00
candles I can go ahead and just adjust
9:03
this offset to 10 or whatever you select
9:06
and that will move these candles to the
9:08
right so you can see those candles now
9:11
have moved to the right and basically
9:13
doubled the offset there the body border
9:15
and Wick of the candles are pretty
9:17
self-explanatory those will just adjust
9:19
the colors of the higher time frame
9:21
candle now the higher time frame open
9:24
this will Mark out the current higher
9:25
time frame open of the higher time frame
9:27
candle so you can see at this 12 a.m.
9:30
hourly candle it is marking out the open
9:32
of that if I wanted to turn that off I
9:34
can go ahead and turn that off there or
9:36
I can adjust these settings between
9:38
solid dashed and dotted now open close
9:41
time is going to be those vertical lines
9:43
which I find very important in my
9:45
analysis for separating the individual
9:47
open high low close so you can see each
9:49
of these three hours over here are
9:51
separated vertically here I can go ahead
9:54
and turn that off if I do not want to
9:56
view it and you can see that is what it
9:58
looks like with it turned off now the
10:00
low and high lines are going to go ahead
10:02
and Mark out the high and low of each
10:04
hour on the lower time frame chart this
10:06
is not something I personally wish to
10:07
see so I go ahead and leave it off for
10:10
my default settings now going into the
10:12
model style do you want to show my
10:14
fractal model labels that is going to be
10:16
the C2 C2 failed C4 all of those labels
10:21
so if I want to have those on I'll have
10:23
those on and I can choose the size of
10:25
them or I can go ahead and turn them off
10:27
if I do not want to view them now the
10:29
Candle One Sweep is going to Mark out
10:31
that first candle that was swept out
10:33
from the higher time frame closure so
10:35
you can see it will Mark out the
10:36
previous candle's High here as well as
10:38
on the lower time frame I personally
10:40
like to view that now here I have the
10:42
choice for my change in the state of
10:44
delivery between two options for a
10:46
bullish change on the state of delivery
10:47
and bearish change on the state of
10:49
delivery I personally keep them the same
10:51
color but some people do want to see the
10:52
bearish change in the state of delivery
10:54
as a different color so for instance if
10:56
I wanted a different color on the
10:57
bearish change in the state of delivery
10:59
I'm going to adjust that setting and
11:01
then you can see it will adjust between
11:02
bearish and bullish now for candle
11:05
equilibrium that is just going to Mark
11:06
out this higher time frame candles EQ so
11:10
you can see it is marked out there as
11:11
well as on the lower time frames if you
11:14
don't want to see that you can go ahead
11:15
and turn that off with the toggle and it
11:17
will
11:19
disappear now for the t-spot this is the
11:22
area in the higher time frame candles
11:24
that I look for the higher time frame
11:25
Wick 2 form so essentially on my short
11:28
setup here I'm expecting price to open
11:31
high go lower and then close so I'm
11:33
anticipating a high to be formed in this
11:35
box so those are the settings for that
11:38
and you can adjust those boxes how you
11:39
see fit by default they will be gray and
11:42
green as that is how I have them now
11:44
going into the projections these are
11:46
currently drawn from the bodies so the
11:48
series of bodies in the change in the
11:50
state of delivery I can go ahead and
11:52
adjust the manual input on these
11:53
projections these are the default
11:55
settings that will be there but let's
11:57
say I wanted to add in something
11:58
different let's say I wanted to add in
12:01
A5 I can just type in a comma
12:05
and5 click out of this and then the
12:07
script will go ahead and add in that
12:09
custom projection so you can see how we
12:11
have just added in a new projection
12:13
there so if you use different
12:15
projections than me you can go ahead and
12:16
add those in manually now with the
12:18
labels of the projections you can go
12:20
ahead and adjust those too however you
12:22
see fit or you can go ahead and turn
12:25
them off entirely by clicking this box
12:27
right here and you can see the labels
12:29
will Disappear Completely now one thing
12:32
I wanted to talk about here is I'm going
12:33
up to the higher time frame on the
12:35
hourly and you can see we should have a
12:37
setup being printed but it is not why is
12:40
that the case so you can see I still
12:41
have my time frame filter marked out
12:43
here which won't show up on the hourly
12:46
so I want to go ahead and adjust the
12:47
choose below period and adjust this to
12:50
something below the current time frame I
12:51
want it to show up on so you can see
12:54
this time filter will only apply on the
12:57
30 minute time frame or below for the
12:59
this given Kill Zone so you can see how
13:00
that now has adjusted to print on the
13:02
chart now the last thing I want to talk
13:04
about is the formation liquidity so you
13:07
can see right here formation liquidity a
13:09
dotted line what is that well given this
13:12
candle closure here and looking bearish
13:14
I want to see price run out previous
13:16
candle's lows or previous day's lows as
13:19
you can see this previous day's low here
13:21
has already been taken however this
13:23
previous day's low has not been taken
13:25
and that gets marked out there by the
13:27
formation liquidity now now the last
13:29
thing we can talk about here is the
13:31
table so you can see down here on the
13:33
right it will go ahead and give me the
13:35
time frame asset what fractal model I am
13:38
set to so you can see because I have it
13:40
on automatic it is currently on the
13:42
daily and hourly the time until close so
13:45
there is 4 hours until this higher time
13:46
frame candle closes my bias I have
13:49
selected so you can see it is currently
13:50
neutral but if I adjust that up here it
13:53
will show and then I can also show my
13:55
time frame filters that I have set now
13:58
all of this is pretty customizable if
14:00
you do have stuff that you want added
14:02
into this indicator I'm always going to
14:04
be improving this so just go ahead and
14:06
shoot me a message and I will see if it
14:08
makes sense but let's go over a couple
14:10
more things such as overlapping the
14:12
indicators so here we are going to go
Overlapping & Examples
14:14
over a few examples of overlapping the
14:17
higher time frame t-spot with a lower
14:19
time frame setup so you can see here we
14:21
are in this higher time frame t-pot we
14:24
have a sweep of these consolidation
14:26
highs and then we close back inside the
14:29
previous bar so looking for price to
14:31
trade lower here what I could do is go
14:34
ahead and copy this indicator by right
14:36
click copy command V and paste on a
14:39
second one move this to the lower time
14:42
frame so instead of having it on the
14:43
daily and hourly go to automatic and
14:46
then I would go down to the 5 minute
14:48
time frame now down here on the 5 minute
14:50
time frame you can see it's a bit messy
14:52
because it's overlaying the higher time
14:54
frame candles with the lower time frame
14:56
candles so I'll go ahead and hide these
14:58
higher time frame candles and I'll just
15:00
view the lower time frame candles here
15:03
so you can see I'm go ahead and remove
15:05
the drawings as we get into this next
15:07
candle you can see it prints the setup
15:10
right so we have the t-spot right here
15:12
on the 5 minute chart so if I was
15:14
looking for a setup to trade lower I
15:16
could either just take an entry here
15:19
with my stop on an invalidation or look
15:21
for a confirmation setup in here and you
15:24
can see what happens
15:27
here we start to trade that lower right
15:31
and you can see we did get a bullish
15:33
setup that printed right here right and
15:36
that did fail right away as it was
15:38
opposing the higher time frame one now
15:40
with the closure lower I'd be looking
15:43
for a continuation out of this area now
15:46
as we let this play
15:50
out you can see once it closes over this
15:53
area that I'm looking for a continuation
15:55
this will turn red because that is not
15:57
ideal for me to be looking for a
15:59
continuation lower when it closes over
16:01
that
16:03
level and you can see that closure right
16:05
there over my level was the early
16:07
warning that this setup was not likely
16:09
to continue so let's go back out to the
16:12
hourly time frame to see if there's any
16:14
other setups so you can see as we get
16:17
into the next day here what occurs is we
16:19
have a candle 2 closure on the daily
16:22
chart setting up an hourly setup so you
16:25
can see if we zoom in I'd be wanting to
16:27
see the higher time frame Wick form in
16:29
this area here and we have a fair value
16:32
Gap here so narrowing down this point of
16:36
Interest I can drop down to the hourly
16:38
and 5 minute to see if a setup occurs in
16:40
this area that is bullish so you can see
16:43
as we let this play out there was a
16:45
bearish
16:46
setup and you can see what do we notice
16:49
the continuation from this bearish setup
16:51
has
16:54
failed and that is what actually creates
16:57
the bullish candle to closure now in
17:00
this area we have the hourly t-pot which
17:02
I'd want to see hold and a 5-minute te-
17:04
spot right here now with the closure
17:06
through these opposing candles here that
17:09
would be an order block I could look to
17:11
take an entry in here my stop on this
17:13
low and looking for 2 R and as we let
17:16
this play
17:17
out you can see we get a continuation
17:20
higher and what else happens with this
17:23
closure on this higher time frame I'd be
17:25
looking for a continuation in this area
17:28
here in candle
17:31
4 you can see now that we have closed
17:34
over those down close Candles there I'd
17:36
anticipate this low to hold if we are
17:38
going to trade
17:40
higher we finally hit that TP there so
17:44
you can see that is what I wanted to
17:45
show was there's a lot of different
17:47
things that you can do with this
17:48
indicator in terms of a Confluence or
17:50
overlapping but you can see how this
17:54
hourly t-spot was then overlapped with
17:56
the 5-minute t-spot and if I really
17:58
wanted to I could go to the lower time
18:00
frames in there for our last example
18:02
here you can see we are on ES on The
18:04
Daily and hourly chart as we let this
18:07
daily candle close let's see what
18:09
happens you can see our daily candle has
18:11
closed inside the previous day high as
18:14
shown here and here we have a candle two
18:17
closure with a change in the state of
18:19
delivery here are the projections from
18:21
the reversal now if price is going to
18:23
continue lower I'd like to see price
18:25
hold or not close over this t-spot area
18:28
here so as we let this continue to play
18:32
out you can see as we enter the New York
18:35
session we have just Consolidated so
18:37
with a consolidation I'd like to see a
18:40
manipulation before we get
18:43
expansion here you can see we manipulate
18:46
this side of the range so where would I
18:48
like to see price reach for well ideally
18:50
using the formation liquidity or the
18:52
previous day's low over here which is
18:54
marked out and in line with the
18:56
projections I'd like to see price expand
18:58
to these
19:00
lows you can see price then expands to
19:04
those lows and hits the targets and that
Outro
19:07
will conclude the video with the
19:09
introduction to my fractal model as well
19:11
as showcasing my indicator if there is
19:13
anything that I missed with in this
19:15
video in regards to settings or the
19:17
indicator feel free to leave a comment
19:19
in the comment section below and I'll
19:21
get those answered but with that I hope
19:23
you have a great rest of your day and
19:24
I'll see you guys next time
