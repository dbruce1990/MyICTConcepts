# Equilibrium

### **Using Discount and Premium**

There are two ways discount and premium, or equilibrium is used in the model.

**Ranges**

By using equilibrium of ranges, targets can be framed when trading back into the range. Equilibrium is also used to identify points of interest for trading out of the range.

When trading into the range, equilibrium is an objective.

When trading out of a range, equilibrium is a point of interest.

**Previous Candle Equilibrium**

The main way equilibrium is applied within this model is by using equilibrium of the previous candle range or the previous candle wick. This will be discussed in further detail within upcoming lessons.

For reversals with large wicks, equilibrium of the previous candle wick is used as framework. The following candle should remain in respect to this level for a valid reversal.

For a continuation, equilibrium of the previous candle range is used as framework. The following candle should remain in respect to this level for a valid continuation.
