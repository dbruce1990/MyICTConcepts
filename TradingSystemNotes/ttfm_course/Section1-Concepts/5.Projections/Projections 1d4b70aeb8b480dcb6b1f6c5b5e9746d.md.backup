# Projections

### **Determining Targets**

As discussed in the previous lesson, equilibrium and liquidity can be used both as trade objectives and points of interest for a potential reversal. For the TTrades Model, the main focus for identifying targets is highs and lows and pairing with standard deviation projections.

There are two ways to project the reversal:

**Manipulation Projection**

Anchoring the projection will be done this way in the majority of scenarios:

Bullish: low to the previous high which made the highest high

Bearish: high to the previous low which made the lowest low

**Failure Swing Projection**

The projection changes in certain scenarios when the manipulation leg is large. What is a large manipulation leg? When the projection is far overextended from any price logical objective for candle 3 or 4 to reach.

Bullish: lowest low to the high which formed the failure swing

Bearish: highest high to the low which formed the failure swing
