# Opposing Candles

### **Using Opposing Candles**

During an intraday expansion, anticipate price to respect opposing close candles to the objectives.

**Defining Opposing Candles**

There are two principles to follow when marking out opposing close candles.

1. If there are a series of opposing close candles, use the opening price of the first candle in the series

Series of downclose candles: use the opening price of the highest downclose candle in the series

Series of upclose candles: use the opening price of the lowest upclose candle in the series

2. Ignore opposing close candles that are within a larger series of opposing close candles

Downclose candles within a larger series of downclose candles: focus on the larger series

Upclose candles within a larger series of upclose candles: focus on the larger series

**Where To Look For Opposing Candles**

Opposing close candles should be supported by one of three points of interest; highs or lows, fair value gaps, and opposing close candles. Any opposing close candles which are not paired with a point of interest should be ignored and avoided.

Read on to learn about the three points of interest:

**Highs and Lows**

Once either a high or low is swept, a closure through a series of opposing candles is the confirmation.

**SMT**

Opposing close candles on the failure swing are used when an SMT is present.

**Fair Value Gaps**

Once a fair gap is traded into, a closure through a series of opposing candles is the confirmation.

**Opposing Candles**

Opposing close candles which form in respect to a previous series of opposing close candles. This is only used if there is no high / low or fair value gap to trade into.

**Measuring 0.5 of the Opposing Candle (CISD)**

For a reversal to remain valid, it will remain in respect to the opposing candles that traded into the point of interest. Anchor a 0.5 fib retracement tool to the highest candle body to lowest candle body in the series:

When bullish, price should remain above 0.5 of the series of downclose candles

When bearish, price should remain below 0.5 of the series of upclose candles

To visualize this area, a rectangle can be used to highlight the range from the opening price of the series to the 0.5 level from the previous step.
