**Intra-candle CISD (IC-CISD)**

With the T-spot showing where a higher timeframe wick is likely to form, how can we confirm that wick to have formed? Just as a CISD was used to confirm the reversal and swing point, a CISD will be used to confirm the wick has formed. This is what I coined an Intra-candle CISD.

Waiting for an opposing candle formation within the specific higher time frame candle being traded.

If trading candle 3, wait for an opposing candle to form within candle 3

If trading candle 4, wait for an opposing candle to form within candle 4

This is allowing the upper or lower wick of the expansion candle to form and then catching the expansion move (body of the candle). Not trying to pick the high or low of the candle.

Here price has reached into a point of interest - fair value gap - inside the T-Spot (not shown). Currently price is still forming its upper wick, or it has yet to confirm the wick has formed.

Now with price forming a series of opposing candles within candle 3, the intra-candle CISD has formed. This validates the current high as the wick high of candle 3 and can seek entries.

Price expands and forms the body of candle 3 after the wick was formed and confirmed by the IC-CISD.

The same concept applies in candle 4 as price opens, forms the high - this high is then validated with the IC-CISD and price trades away closing near the lows.
