# Bias

### **Bias**

The goal of the bias section is to determine a higher timeframe direction. Then using a lower timeframe fractal model to get onside, inline with the higher timeframe bias.

- If the Daily or 4 Hour charts are bearish, look for bearish lower timeframe fractal models (1H-m5), (m30/m3).
- If the Daily or 4 Hour charts are bullish, look for bullish lower timeframe fractal models (1H-m5), (m30/m3).

Now although fractal concept and can be applied to other timeframes, as an intraday trader, the Daily and 4 Hour charts are the focus.

**Swing Points**

As stated in the previous sections of the course, each reversal in the market must form a swing point. This can be used to anticipate the direction via the daily chart.

The easiest days are the continuations (day 3/4) in line with applying the fractal model to the daily chart.

- Candle 2 closure - looking to trade within candle 3 and with a good closure, candle 4.
- Candle 3 closure - looking to trade within candle 4.

**Closures**

What is a good closure?

If looking for a continuation, price will close outside the previous bar.

- bearish continuation - closure below previous candle low
- bullish continuation - closure above previous candle high

If looking for a reversal, price will fail to close outside the previous bar

- bullish reversal - closure above previous candle low
- bearish reversal - closure below previous candle high

**Equilibrium (EQ)**

Equilibrium as discussed in the previous section can be paired with swings and closures on the daily chart when looking for a continuation or reversal.

With price closing outside its previous bar and respecting the EQ, a continuation can be anticipated.

If price fails to respect the EQ, it likely to reverse. This can be paired with closures.

**Phases Of Price**

Price moves between a series of small ranges and large ranges.

These ranges can be defined as

- consolidation
- expansion
- retracement
- reversal

Price always goes to expansion, from here it can do 3 things

- reverse
- consolidate
- retrace

If price reverses, it is likely to continue in the opposite direction. This will look like expansion in both directions or a “V shape”

If price retraces, it is likely to continue with another expansion. This will look like a slow shallow move back into the range before continuing.

If price consolidates, it is likely to be range bound until price then goes to expansion and the cycle repeats.

**Draw On Liquidity**

Ultimately, price is drawing to a high or a low on the daily chart. The goal is to determine which direction this is and then align with that.
