# Entry Sequence

### **Entry Sequence**

**Entry Sequence**

There are two potential entries to be taken under this model once price reaches a relevant point of interest.

The first is entering on the initial swing formation at the closure of candle 2 or 3 which starts the reversal. Swing entries prior to closing through the opposing candles provide higher reward, but come with greater risk as the high or low is yet to be confirmed.

This is an example of a potential swing entry (candle 2 closure) as it provides great RR, but the high or low has not been validated with an opposing candle formation.

The second is entering on the close through the opposing candles following the reversal. Entries on the opposing candle formation generally provide less reward, but are with less risk as the high or low is confirmed.

With the close through the series of opposing candles, the high or low is confirmed and the invalidation point is provided.

The following entry sequences are only valid at a relevant point of interest. Shown above is the entry sequence formed at a high or low. Here is the Entry Sequence for a fair value gap and opposing candles. Now remember, only use opposing candles if there is neither a fair value gap or a high or low as a point of interest.

Below are the ways to seek entries into the market:

**Candle 2 Closure Entry**

With a valid candle 2 closure, enter on the opening of candle 3 with a stop loss on the candle 2 swing point.

**Candle 3 Closure Entry**

With a valid candle 3 closure, enter on the opening of candle 4 with a stop loss on the candle 2 swing point.

**CISD and Opposing Candle Entries**

Entering following the confirmation of a relevant opposing candle; either market on the opening of the first candle following the validation or a limit on the opposing candles.

**Minimum Risk to Reward**

2R is the minimum requirement before taking profit on an open position. Profit will be taken at projections, liquidity levels, opposing candles, and opposing swing formations.

**Trailing Stop Loss**

Stop loss will be trailed to opposing candles or validated swing points that should not be returned
