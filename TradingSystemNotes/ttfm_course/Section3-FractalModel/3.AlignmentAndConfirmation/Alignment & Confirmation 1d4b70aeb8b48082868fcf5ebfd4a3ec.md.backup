# Alignment & Confirmation

### **Alignment and Confirmation**

Once a valid candle 2 closure or candle 3 closure has been identified, a lower timeframe confirmation must be present to continue - see flow chart at end of course. This lower timeframe confirmation will be a change in the state of delivery or a CISD. This is the same as the opposing candles lesson.

Below are the timeframe pairings to be used:

**Swing Point → CISD in Candle 2**

Weekly Swing Point → 4 Hour CISD

Daily Swing Point → 1 Hour CISD

4 Hour Swing Point → 15 Minute CISD

1 Hour Swing Point → 5 Minute CISD

30 Minute Swing Point → 3 Minute CISD

15 Minute Swing Point → 1 Minute CISD

Here is an example of a valid candle 2 closure on the higher timeframe. The next step is to verify if there is a lower timeframe CISD.

Projections can then be added to the manipulation leg

Following the flow chart. Once there is a valid closure and paired with the confirmation on the aligned timeframe, entries can be taken.
