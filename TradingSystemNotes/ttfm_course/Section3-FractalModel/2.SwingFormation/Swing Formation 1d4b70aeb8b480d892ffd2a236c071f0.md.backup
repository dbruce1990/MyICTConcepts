# Swing Formation

### **Swing Formation**

After aligning with a higher timeframe bias, the next step in the fractal model is to identify a candle 2 closure or a candle 3 closure.

Now when looking for a candle 2 or candle 3 closure, the most important thing is that it happens at a relevant level. This will be either a Fair Value Gap (FVG), High or Low, and only if neither of the first two are present will an opposing candle be used.

Here is an example of a swing formation at a fair value gap

A swing forming at an opposing candle (CISD). This is only used when there is neither a fair value gap or a high or low to be the point of interest.
