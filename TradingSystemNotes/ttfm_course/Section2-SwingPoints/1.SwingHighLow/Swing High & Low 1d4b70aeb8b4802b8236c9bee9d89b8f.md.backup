# Swing High & Low

### **Understanding Swing Highs & Lows**

The market must form a swing high or low in order for price to reverse; there is no other way. Using that understanding is the foundation of the TTrades Model.

There are 3 candles that form a swing high or low. The focus will be on those 3 candles with the 3rd and 4th candles having potential opportunity following the swing high or low.

**Numbering Candles**

Candle 1 will always be the candle before the high or low

Candle 2 will always be the candle that forms the high or low

Candle 3 will always be the candle following the high or low

Candle 4 will always be the candle following candle 3

Below is an example of numbering the candles:
