### **Reversal Candle Closure**

This is the first of the two swing formations focused on within the model.

**Candle 2**

Bullish: takes the low of candle 1 and closes back above candle 1 low

Bearish: takes the high of candle 1 and closes back below candle 1 high

With a valid candle 2 closure, there is an anticipation for candle 3 to expand.

With a strong bearish or bullish closure on candle 3, candle 4 is likely to be a continuation.
