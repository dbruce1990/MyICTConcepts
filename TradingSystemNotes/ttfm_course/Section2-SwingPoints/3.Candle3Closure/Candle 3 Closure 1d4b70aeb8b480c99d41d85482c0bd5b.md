# Candle 3 Closure

### **Conditional Rule**

This is the second of the two swing formations focused on within the model.

**Candle 3**

Due to candle 2 failing to close inside the range of candle 1, more data is needed to determine if this is likely a swing formation. Allow candle 3 to form without participating, this is the best option in this scenario.

If candle 3 closes through the opening price of candle 2, this validates the formation of the swing. Due to this closure on candle 3, candle 4 becomes a likely continuation away from the previously established swing point.

Below is what a candle 4 continuation looks like within this conditional scenario.
