# Reference Indicators

This directory contains reference implementations, documentation, and analysis of indicators that inspire or inform our ICT trading system development.

## Structure

Each indicator gets its own subdirectory containing:
- `script.pine` - The Pine Script code (with proper syntax highlighting)
- `README.md` - Detailed explanation and analysis  
- `screenshots/` - Visual examples and demonstrations
- `notes.md` - Development insights and lessons learned

## Current References

### TTrades_Fractal_Model/
Documentation and analysis of the commercial TTrades Fractal Model indicator that we're recreating with enhancements.
