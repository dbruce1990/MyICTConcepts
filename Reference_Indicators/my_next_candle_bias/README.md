This is my variation of TTrades' "next day model". It was simply an adaptation of TFO's "TTrades Daily Bias [TFO]" indicator (link to TFO's indicator explination here: https://www.tradingview.com/script/xdwgV3Fx-TTrades-Daily-Bias-TFO/) and helps showcase at least one possible way of detecting "c1, c2, c3, c4" candles. 

When reviewing and understanding this the bias.pine script, keep in mind the inspiration from TFO's "TTrades Dialy Bias" script that i will put under /ttrades_daily_bias_tfo folder for inspiration.
