## Project Context
I am developing an ICT (Inner Circle Trader) concepts indicator in Pine Script v6 that recreates the commercial TTrades Fractal Model with personal enhancements. The project is based on multi-timeframe analysis using swing points, Fair Value Gaps (FVGs), and Change in State of Delivery (CISD) detection.

## Key Concepts & Definitions

### ICT Trading Terminology
- **Order Block**: Same as CISD - opening price violation of a swing point that creates liquidity
- **Protected Swing Point**: Same as Order Block - these terms are interchangeable in our system
- **CISD (Change in State of Delivery)**: The most critical component - represents order block formation when swing point opening price is violated
- **FVG (Fair Value Gap)**: 3-candle pattern with gap between high/low of outer candles
- **BISI**: Bearish FVG (Bearish Institutional Support/Resistance Imbalance) 
- **SIBI**: Bullish FVG (Support/Resistance Institutional Bearish Imbalance)
- **C2 Closure**: HTF candle close that triggers expansion moments in TTrades methodology
- **Next Candle Model**: Statistical bias system with 63-67% success rates using PCH/PCL logic

### Technical Architecture
- **Main Script**: `script.pine` (495 lines) with swing points, FVGs, CISD detection
- **Multi-timeframe Hierarchy**: Weekly‚Üí4hr‚Üí15m‚Üí1m with HTF bias providing LTF confirmation
- **HTF Integration**: Higher timeframe provides bias/targets, lower timeframe provides execution signals
- **Statistical Foundation**: TTrades Daily Bias provides mechanical bias calculation (PCH/PCL methodology)

## Pine Script v6 Requirements

### Critical Rules (ALWAYS FOLLOW)
1. **Indentation**: ALWAYS use 4 spaces (never tabs) - this prevents 90% of syntax errors
2. **Drawing Limits**: Set max_boxes_count, max_lines_count, max_labels_count in indicator declaration
3. **Array Bounds**: Check array.size() before array.get() calls
4. **Time Coordinates**: Use xloc.bar_time for persistent drawings, xloc.bar_index for temporary
5. **Barstate Handling**: Use barstate.isconfirmed for final calculations, barstate.islast for updates

### Common Error Prevention
- "Cannot call 'array.get' with argument 'id'=na" ‚Üí Always initialize arrays and check bounds
- "Index out of bounds" ‚Üí Add if array.size() > index checks before access
- Drawing object limits ‚Üí Implement cleanup methods and object pooling
- Indentation errors ‚Üí Always verify 4-space indentation consistency

- Dynamic color coding (Gray‚ÜíRed‚ÜíOrange) for setup states
- Projection system for future price targets
- Complete automation with customizable timeframe pairings

## TTrades Methodology Foundation

### The Fractal Model Logic
1. **Cyclical Nature**: Price alternates between large and small ranges
2. **Expansion Mechanics**: Occurs with directional momentum 
3. **HTF + LTF Integration**: HTF closures + LTF CISD = Expansion moments
4. **Non-repainting**: Stable levels within time periods
5. **Universal Application**: Works across assets, markets, timeframes

### Bias Assignment Rules (Mechanical)
- Close Above PDH ‚Üí Bias PDH
- Close Below PDL ‚Üí Bias PDL
- Failed to Close Above PDH ‚Üí Bias PDL  
- Failed to Close Below PDL ‚Üí Bias PDH
- Inside Bar ‚Üí Previous session direction bias
- Outside Bar (closes inside) ‚Üí No bias

## Communication Preferences

### When Providing Code
- Always use 4-space indentation
- Include drawing object limit considerations
- Add array bounds checking where needed
- Explain complex algorithms in comments
- Reference our existing type definitions (SwingPoint, FVG, CISD)

### When Discussing Features
- Connect to TTrades methodology and our reference implementations
- Consider multi-timeframe implications
- Discuss statistical validation approaches
- Reference our organized documentation structure

### Context Assumptions
- Assume familiarity with our complete reference system
- No need to re-explain ICT concepts, order blocks, or swing points
- Focus on implementation details and integration strategies
- Reference existing documentation rather than recreating explanations

## Knowledge Base Integration
All technical context, reference materials, and methodology documentation is preserved in organized README files with official TradingView links. New conversations should leverage this existing knowledge base rather than starting from scratch.

## Development Philosophy
Focus on recreating the TTrades Fractal Model with enhancements while maintaining the mechanical, statistical foundation. Prioritize reliability, performance, and comprehensive documentation for future development sessions.

## Knowledge Base Maintenance Instructions

### When Discovering New Recurring Issues
1. **Document Immediately**: Add to `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md` with problem/solution format
2. **Update This File**: Add critical issues to the Pine Script v6 Requirements section
3. **Update Knowledge Base**: Reflect changes in `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`
4. **Version Control**: Commit changes to preserve solutions for future sessions

### When Learning New Methodology Insights  
1. **Document in Trading System Docs**: Add to methodology explanations
2. **Update Reference READMEs**: Enhance understanding in relevant indicator documentation
3. **Cross-reference**: Ensure all related files are updated consistently
4. **Preserve Context**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for context switching
